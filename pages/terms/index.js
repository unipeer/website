        <p className="font-Inter">
          Trading of crypto assets may result in total loss of your investment.
          Sale and purchase of crypto assets such as ETHEREUM involves a high
          degree of risk to your capital. The value of your cryptocurrency
          assets may increase or decrease at any time and there is no guarantee
          on return of capital.‍ Cryptos may not be appropriate purchases for
          all individuals and you should seek independent advice prior to
          purchasing any Crypto. Additionally, the availability of UniPeer and
          your ability to use the services may be detrimentally impacted by
          regulatory changes and uncertainty.‍ If you use UniPeer and trade in
          crypto assets via UniPeer, you will represent that you are able to
          bear such risk.
